    <h1>Can patients prescribed fruits and vegetables achieve better health outcomes?</h1>
    <div class="lexicon">
      <p>Eating the right food plays an important role in a person’s overall health and in treating diet-responsive conditions. Geisinger pairs fresh and nutritious foods with education and clinical services as part of a prescription-based program and provides this program to their most at-risk patients with diabetes. In doing so, it has improved patient outcomes while lowering per-patient costs.</p>
      <p>The Fresh Food Farmacy program provides qualifying patients with education, clinical services, and access to fresh, healthy, nutritious food. These resources empower participants in the program to manage their medical conditions through food-related behavior modifications and lifestyle changes.</p>
      <p>In comparison to a cohort population of people who participate, but do not enroll, in the Fresh Food Farmacy program, enrolled patients have demonstrated the following benefits of the program:</p>
      <ul><li>75% fewer hospital admissions</li>
        <li>30% fewer Emergency Room visits</li>
        <li>More regular visits with primary care physicians, reducing gaps in preventative care</li></ul>
      <p>In addition, participating patients with type 2 diabetes average a 2-point reduction in HbA1c, potentially leading to savings of $16,000-$24,000 in healthcare costs per patient, according to published literature.</p>
      <p>Geisinger Health Plan elected Scranton, PA as its third Fresh Food Farmacy location. A Community Needs Assessment identified alarming rates of diabetes coupled with increasing food insecurity statistics in the area, where hunger, job security, transportation, and stable housing are the biggest social determinants that impact the health outcomes of Scranton residents. Without job security, individuals struggle to pay for the food they need. Lack of reliable transportation, coupled with numerous food deserts, leads many patients to rely on food service locations that may not always offer the most nutritious options. For those without stable housing, storing food acquired from local pantries can also be a challenge.</p>
